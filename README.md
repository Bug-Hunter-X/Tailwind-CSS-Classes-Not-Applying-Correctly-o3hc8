# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly in specific situations. The issue is likely related to either configuration problems, style conflicts, or missing dependencies.

## Bug Description

Certain Tailwind CSS utility classes are not being rendered, resulting in unexpected styling behavior.  The `bg-red-500` and `p-4` classes are not applied as expected in the provided example.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
3. Run the application.
4. Observe the unexpected styling in the browser.

## Solution

The solution involves checking the following:

* **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured in your project and that the required purge options (if using `purge` in production) are correctly setup to remove unused CSS rules, in order to ensure that Tailwind CSS classes are correctly applied.
* **CSS Specificity:** Check for conflicting styles or styles with higher specificity that might override Tailwind CSS classes.
* **Dependencies:** Verify that all necessary Tailwind CSS dependencies are installed and updated to the latest versions.
* **Typographical Errors:** Carefully review all class names for potential typos.
* **Build Process:** Make sure your build process correctly includes Tailwind CSS styles.
